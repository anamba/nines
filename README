Nines is a simple server monitoring tool written in Ruby. It reads in hand-coded YAML config files (see config.yml.sample). Rename to config.yml and edit as needed before first run.

To start: ./nines
To stop:  ./nines stop

When run, it forks into the background and runs in a continuous loop. If there are bugs in the code (likely) it may die, so keep tabs on it using monit or similar.
